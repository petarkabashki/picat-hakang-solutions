  For loops in Picat.

  From Rosetta Code:

  """
  'For' loops are used to make some block of code be iterated a number of times, 
  setting a variable or parameter to a monotonically increasing integer value 
  for each execution of the block of code. Common extensions of this allow 
  other counting patterns or iterating over abstract structures other than the integers.

  For this task, show how two loops may be nested within each other, with the number 
  of iterations performed by the inner for loop being controlled by the outer for 
  loop. Specifically print out the following pattern by using one for loop nested in 
  another:
