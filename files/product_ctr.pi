  Constraint

      product_ctr(VARIABLES,CTR,VAR)

  Purpose

      Constraint the product of a set of domain variables. More precisely, 
      let P denote the product of the variables of the VARIABLES collection. 
      Enforce the following constraint to hold: P CTR VAR.

  Example
      (<2,1,4>,=,8)

      The product_ctr constraint holds since its last argument VAR=8 is 
      equal (i.e., CTR is set to =) to 2*1*4.
