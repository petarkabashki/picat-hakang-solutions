  Global constraint derangement in Picat.

  From Global Constraint Catalogue

  """
  Enforce to have a permutation with no cycle of length one. The permutation 
  is depicted by the succ attribute of the NODES collection.
  
  Example
      (
     <
     index-1    succ-2,
     index-2    succ-1,
     index-3    succ-5,
     index-4    succ-3,
     index-5    succ-4
     >
     )
  In the permutation of the example we have the following 2 cycles: 1->2->1 and
  3->5->4->3. Since these cycles have both a length strictly greater than 
  one the corresponding derangement constraint holds.
