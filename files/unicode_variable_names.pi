  """
  Describe, and give a pointer to documentation on your languages use of characters 
  beyond those of the ASCII character set in the naming of variables.

  Show how to: 
    - Set a variable with a name including the 'Δ', (delta character), to 1
    - Increment it
    - Print its value.

  From the Picat Guide:
  "A variable name is an identifier that begins with a capital letter or the underscore."

  Implicit: Character set of Picat is UTF-8.
