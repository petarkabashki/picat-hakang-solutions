  Recreational mathematics in Picat.

  From Pascal Van Henrentyck "The OPL Optimization Programming Language", 
  page 32:
  """
  Consider finding an eight digit number that is a square and remains a square
  when 1 is concatenated in front of its decimal notation.
  """

  There are two solutions:

   n=23765625
   x=4875
   y=11125

   n=56250000
   x=7500
   y=12500
