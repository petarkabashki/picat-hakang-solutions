  Stolen money problem in Picat.

  From Richard Wiseman:
  "it's the Friday Puzzle"
  http://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2013/06/14/its-the-friday-puzzle-215/
  """
  The police know that either Dick, Jack, Sally, or Jimmy have stolen some money. 
  Each suspects makes a statement, but only one of the statements is true.
    Dick said, "I didnâ€™t do it".
    Jack said, "Dick is lying".
    Sally said, "Jack is lying".
    Jimmy said, "Jack did it".

  Who committed the crime?
