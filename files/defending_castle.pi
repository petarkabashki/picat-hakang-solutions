  Defending the Castle puzzle in Picat.

  From http://www.cut-the-knot.org/do_you_know/lin_pr.shtml
  """
  Assume that we have decided to position defenders of a square castle according to the following plan:

  p q p
  q 0 q
  p q p

  so that the total number of defenders is 4(p+q) while (2p+q) fighters face 
  the enemy on every side. Let's denote p = x1 and q = x2. Let also A = (4 4), 
  be a 1x2 matrix, and c = (2 1), a 1x2 row vector. Assume that a 1x1 vector 
  b is equal to (28). The linear programming problem (P) is then interpreted 
  as:
  How to position 28 fighters according to the symmetric arrangement above 
  so as to have the maximum number of defenders on each side?
