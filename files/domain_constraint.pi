  Global constraint domain_constraint in Picat.

  """
  domain_constraint(VAR,VALUES)
  
  Purpose

  Make the link between a domain variable VAR and those 0-1 variables 
  that are associated with each potential value of VAR: The 0-1 variable 
  associated with the value that is taken by variable VAR is equal to 1, 
  while the remaining 0-1 variables are all equal to 0.

  Example
      (
      5, <
      var01-0 value-9,
      var01-1 value-5,
      var01-0 value-2,
      var01-0 value-7
      >
      )

   The domain_constraint holds since VAR=5 is set to the value corresponding to the 0-1 variable set 
   to 1, while the other 0-1 variables are all set to 0.
