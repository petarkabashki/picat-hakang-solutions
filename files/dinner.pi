  """
  My son came to me the other day and said, "Dad, I need help with a"
  "math problem." The problem went like this:

    * We're going out to dinner taking 1-6 grandparents, 1-10 parents and/or 1-40 children
    * Grandparents cost $3 for dinner, parents $2 and children $0.50
    * There must be 20 total people at dinner and it must cost $20
    * How many grandparents, parents and children are going to dinner?
