  Global constraint atmost_nvalue in Picat.

  From Global Constraint Catalogue
  http://www.emn.fr/x-info/sdemasse/gccat/Catmost_nvalue.html
  """
  The number of distinct values taken by the variables of the 
  collection VARIABLES is less than or equal to NVAL.
  
  Example
     (4, <3, 1, 3, 1, 6>)

  The atmost_nvalue constraint holds since the collection <3, 1, 3, 1, 6> 
  involves at most 4 distinct values (i.e., in fact 3 distinct values).
