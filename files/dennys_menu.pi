  Denny's Menu problem in Picat.

  From http://mindyourdecisions.com/blog/2011/12/01/dennys-math-commercial
  """
  So thereâ€™s the question: how many different price combinations will 
  total $10 when menu items priced at $2, $4, $6, and $8?
  """
  
  Answer: There are 6 different combinations:

  [5, 0, 0, 0]
  [3, 1, 0, 0]
  [1, 2, 0, 0]
  [2, 0, 1, 0]
  [0, 1, 1, 0] 
  [1, 0, 0, 1]
