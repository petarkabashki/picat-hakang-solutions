  Global constraint in_interval in Picat.

  From Global Constraint Catalogue
  http://www.emn.fr/x-info/sdemasse/gccat/Cin_interval.html
  """
  in_interval(VAR,LOW,UP)
  
  Purpose

  Enforce the domain variable VAR to take a value within the interval
  [LOW, UP].
  
  Example
      (3,2,5)
  
  The in_interval constraint holds since its first argument VAR=3 is greater 
  than or equal to its second argument LOW=2 and less than or equal 
  to its third argument UP=5.
