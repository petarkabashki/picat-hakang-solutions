  Global constraint lex_greater in Picat.

  From Global Constraint Catalogue
  http://www.emn.fr/x-info/sdemasse/gccat/Clex_greater.html
  """
  lex_greater(VECTOR1, VECTOR2)
  
  Purpose

  VECTOR1 is lexicographically strictly greater than VECTOR2. Given two 
  vectors, X and Y of n components, 〈X0, ..., Xn−1〉 and 〈Y0, ...,Yn−1〉, 
  X is lexicographically strictly greater than Y if and only if X0> Y0 
  or X0=Y0 and 〈X1, ..., Xn−1〉 is lexicographically strictly greater 
  than 〈Y1, ..., Yn−1〉.
  
  Example
    (
    <5, 2, 7, 1>,
    <5, 2, 6, 2>
    )
  
  The lex_greater constraint holds since VECTOR1=<5, 2, 7, 1> is 
  lexicographically strictly greater than VECTOR2=<5, 2, 6, 2>.
