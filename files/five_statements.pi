  Five statements problem in Picat.

  From 
  "Puzzle: Joyner’s five statements"
  http://strathmaths.wordpress.com/2012/10/17/puzzle-joyners-five-statements/
  """
  The following little logical teaser appears as "Ponderable 1.1.3" in 
  David Joyner's book Adventures in Group Theory (Johns Hopkins University 
  Press, 2008; also available to download for free).
  
  Determine which of the following statements is true.
  
   - Exactly one of these statements is false.
   - Exactly two of these statements are false.
   - Exactly three of these statements are false.
   - Exactly four of these statements are false.
   - Exactly five of these statements are false.
  
  (Enthusiasts might like to consider the "natural" generalisation to n statements, 
  and in particular the case n=1…) Thanks to Dr André Sonnet for pointing this 
  one out to me!
