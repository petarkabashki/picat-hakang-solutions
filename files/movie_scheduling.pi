  Movie scheduling problem in Picat.

  From Steven Skiena "The Algorithm Design Manual", page 9ff.

  Data from figure 1.5 (where I have estimated the times).
  
  Movie                      Interval
  -----------------------------------
  Tarjan of the Jungle         4..13
  The Four Volume Problem     17..27
  The President's Algorist     1..10
  Steiner's Tree              12..18
  Process Terminated          23..30
  Halting State                9..16
  Programming Challenges      19..25
  "Discrete" Mathematics       2..7
  Calculated Bets             26..31
