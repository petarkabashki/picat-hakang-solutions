  Global constraint among_modulo in Picat.

  From Global Constraint Catalogue
  http://www.emn.fr/x-info/sdemasse/gccat/Camong_modulo.html
  """
  NVAR is the number of variables of the collection VARIABLES taking a value 
  that is congruent to REMAINDER modulo QUOTIENT.
  
  Example
  (3, <4, 5, 8, 4, 1>, 0, 2)
  
  In this example REMAINDER = 0 and QUOTIENT = 2 specifies that we count the 
  number of even values taken by the different variables. As a consequence 
  the among_modulo constraint holds since exactly 3 values of the 
  collection <4, 5, 8, 4, 1> are even.
