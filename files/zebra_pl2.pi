  Zebra puzzle (Prolog style) in Picat.

  From the Prolog solution of http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Zebra_puzzle
  """
  The Zebra puzzle, a.k.a. Einstein's Riddle, is a logic puzzle which is to be solved 
  programmatically. It has several variants, one of them this:

    There are five houses.
    The English man lives in the red house.
    The Swede has a dog.
    The Dane drinks tea.
    The green house is immediately to the left of the white house.
    They drink coffee in the green house.
    The man who smokes Pall Mall has birds.
    In the yellow house they smoke Dunhill.
    In the middle house they drink milk.
    The Norwegian lives in the first house.
    The man who smokes Blend lives in the house next to the house with cats.
    In a house next to the house where they have a horse, they smoke Dunhill.
    The man who smokes Blue Master drinks beer.
    The German smokes Prince.
    The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
    They drink water in a house next to the house where they smoke Blend. 

  The question is, who owns the zebra?

  Additionally, list the solution for all the houses. Optionally, show the solution is unique.
